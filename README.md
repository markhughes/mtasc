# MTASC

> **Notice**: This is a fork of slightly more maintained [mtasc](https://github.com/grumpy-cat-whatever/mtasc) and [mtasc-install](https://github.com/grumpy-cat-whatever/mtasc-install).

This get sthe project building as the latest builds are outdated and don't run on a modern operating system.

MTASC stands for MotionTwin ActionScript Compiler.

It was an open source AS2 compiler which Nicolas Cannasse wrote at MotionTwin back in time, and somehow the grandfather of Haxe.
